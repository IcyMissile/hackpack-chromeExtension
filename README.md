# hackpack-chromeExtension

This Chrome extension is a simple hackpack that changes dollar amounts on websites to numbers of cleft lip and cleft palate surgeries that can be completed with donation.

The *starterkit* branch has a skeleton code to access text elements, and you can fill in the replaced text with any value. 

**manifest.json** includes required chrome extension values.

**content.js** is the code to find the replace text on websites.

**popup.html** is a simple link to the operation smile donation page.

**popup.js** allows the link to operation smile to be created on a new tab.
